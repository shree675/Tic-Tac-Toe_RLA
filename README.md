# Tic-Tac-Toe Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## About
This project implements a tic-tac-toe agent using different RL algorithms such as value iteration, policy iteration and Q-learning.

### Statistics
* **Value iteration**: #wins ≥98%
* **Policy iteration**: #wins ≥94%
* **Q-learning**: #wins ≥96%

## Setup and Installation
- Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/.
- Run the following:

  ```powershell
  $ pip3 install numpy
  $ pip3 install scipy
  $ pip3 install pygame
  ```

- In each of the folders in the project, run **main.py** to execute the program:
  ```powershell
  $ python main.py
  ```
